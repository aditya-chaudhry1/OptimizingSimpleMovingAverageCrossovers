=======================================

This project applies optimization algorithms to financial data in order to find two Simple Moving Average (SMA) time frames whose crossover allows investors to quickly predict movements in stock price with a high level of confidence.

To run the project, simply run the Python file entitle "GUI3.py".

The only dependency for this project is numpy.
